<p style="font-size:50px;">​IT Project has been taking amazing photos of all animals large and small that people hold dear. We know that though there are a lot of people out there who value dogs, cats and other fluffy creatures, there are many who have more unusual animals, too. So whether you’re hoping to capture a picture of your dog Rover at his birthday party, or Sebastian the corn snake in his very first tank, give me a call. I know how to make your pet’s pics really stand out.</p>
