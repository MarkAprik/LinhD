<h2 style="text-align:center;">IT Project Website</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;">IT Project has been taking amazing photos of all animals large and small that people hold dear. We know that though there are a lot of people out there who value dogs, cats and other fluffy creatures, there are many who have more unusual animals, too. So whether you’re hoping to capture a picture of your dog Rover at his birthday party, or Sebastian the corn snake in his very first tank, give me a call. I know how to make your pet’s pics really stand out.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;">About IT Website</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">IT Website knows that creating the perfect pet portrait doesn’t come by chance. It takes a real professional who understands composition and lighting - and the talent to work with animals that don’t always want to cooperate.
We’ve come to love the process of working with furry friends. We adore those rare and unusual pets you never knew could be captured on film, like lizards, monkeys and even ferrets. If you’re ready to capture a special moment in your pet’s life so you can relive it over and over again.
